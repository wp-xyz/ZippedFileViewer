; This resource must be compiled using TurboPower's String Resource Manager
; Compiler (SRMC), and then the resulting files must be compiled using one of
; Borland's Resource Compilers (BRCC/BRCC32)

; Example command lines for the compilers are:

; 16-bit first stage using SRMC:
; SRMC -16 -foAPW.S16 APW.STR

; 32-bit first stage using SRMC:
; SRMC -32 -foAPW.S32 APW.STR

; 16-bit second stage using BRCC:
; BRCC -dwin16 -foAPW.R16 APW.RC

; 32-bit second stage using BRCC32:
; BRCC32 -32 -foAPW.R32 APW.RC

; Obviously, there may be other options that apply to you. Be sure to check
; the applicable compiler's documentation (README.TXT in the SRMGR's
; subdirectory for SRMC)
